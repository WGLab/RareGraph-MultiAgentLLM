"""Incongruity match score.

Rewards a candidate that explains BOTH the patient's dominant clinical pattern
AND the patient's incongruous phenotypes. This is the score that specifically
lifts cases like CCMS (neurodevelopmental + rib) where the distinguishing
signal is a minority phenotype in a specific organ system.
